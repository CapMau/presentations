    "* Cython translates Python code to equivalent C code.\n",
    "* This code is executed within the CPython runtime environment, but at the speed of compiled C and with the ability to call directly into C libraries. \n",
    "* At the same time, it keeps the original interface of the Python source code, which makes it directly usable from Python code.\n",
    "* This enables Cython's two major use cases:\n",
    "    1. Extending the CPython interpreter with fast binary modules.\n",
    "    2. Interfacing Python code with external C libraries.\n",
    "* While Cython can compile (most) regular Python code, the generated C code usually gains major (and sometime impressive) speed improvements from optional static type declarations for both Python and C types."

    "\n",
    "* Contrary to popular belief, Python is **not** slow because it is interpreted. You could use Cython to convert Python to C and compile it and you would gain minimal speedups.\n",
    "* The main reason that Python is slow is that it's **dynamically** typed.\n",
    "* At the time the program executes, the interpreter *doesn't know the type of the variables* that are defined. Everything is an *object*, everything is in a *box* which results in **boxing–unboxing overhead**.\n",
    "* There is also significant overhead on attribute lookups. For instance, calling a method `f` on an object `a` will cause possible lookups in `__dict__`, calls to `__getattr__`, etc, then finally call `__call__` on the callable object `f`. This process cannot be optimised for the reason metioned above."
